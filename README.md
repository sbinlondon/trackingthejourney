# __Tracking the Journey__ üìà

On the advice of other devs who recently became devs, I want to try and track and measure my progress so I can look back on it and hopefully see how far I've come at some distant, unfathomable point in the future.

### Friday 9th

FAC cohort 14 application window is announced, so I start out with the prerequisites on FreeCodeCamp. Previously I have always become stuck around the time for loops or if/else statements are introduced, and with no real motivation to push through the difficulty, have left it around here.

### Wednesday 14th

I've pushed through where I've gotten stuck before and learn about RegExps, which are genuinely quite cool. It feels good to be making progress past where I usually stopped, and I find that I'm generally much more curious and open to learning this time.

### Wednesday 4th

Complete my final basic algorithm scripting challenge on FCC: Caesar's Cipher. This one took much longer than any of the others, except maybe the ones using filters, and a lot of the prework I scribbled in a notebook offline while on a plane. It felt oddly exhilirating to be able to work through some pseduocode in a notebook without access to MDN and still come up with a bare bones version of the algorithm, then look up the specifics later when online.

### Mon 9th

Booked in an interview with Constructor Labs in the morning and did some coding during an interview. Having someone watch you code makes you feel like you know 50% less immediately but I muddled through. Received an offer for the May cohort later that afternoon. Reached level 6 kyu on Codewars.

### Friday 13th

Submitted my FAC application and prerequisites, having spent the last day wrestling with Flexbox and responsiveness. Clearly I will need to dive into Flexbox and really get to grips with how it works. It feels great to know that a month and a half ago I was in that same place I've always been - stuck amongst for loops and not motivated to really untangle myself - and now I have a basic, broad enough understanding of JS to start building on and learning in my own spare time.

### Tuesday 17th

FAC interview confirmed for April 25! :tada: 

### Monday 23rd

Began learning about jQuery on Codecademy. From what I hear it's not totally in favour but I want to learn about it anyways, if only to see what's been used before and where new things might spring from.
